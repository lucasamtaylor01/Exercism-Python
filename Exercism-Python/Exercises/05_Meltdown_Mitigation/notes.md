# Comments and Observations About the Exercise

# Copilot changes

1. **Removing the `pass` uncessary:** at the end of the `efficiency_band` function is unnecessary and can be removed.
2. **Add docstrings for the `efficiency_band` function**: The `efficiency_band` function does not have a docstring. Add one to describe what the function does.
3. **Improve readability**: Add whitespace to improve the readability of the code.
4. **Check input types**: Add type checks to ensure that input parameters are of the expected type.
5. **Use constants for efficiency limits**: Define constants for efficiency limits to make code easier to maintain.
